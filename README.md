# Spring Boot Rest Api Demo

Complete Rest Api developed in Spring Boot,

Run the project and access and access `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students`

You also could use Postman to get, post, put or delete data on api by following...

Insert student: Send POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students`
Get all students: Send GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students`
Get one student: Send GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/student_id`
Delete student: Send DELETE request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/student_id`
Update student: Send PUT request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/student_id`

To insert or update also send a json on the body of request like the example below

{
  "age": 18,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "course": "Computer Science"
}

Thanks =)
